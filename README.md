The area for common files on the server is: `/cephyr/NOBACKUP/groups/bbt045_2024/project_group1`

The data may also be downloaded directly from [https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB28019](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB28019) using the [download script](scripts/download_script.sh) and then renamed using [change filename 1](scripts/change_filenames_1.sh) and [change filename 2](scripts/change_filenames_2.sh).
