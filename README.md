## Question
How pharmaceutical pollution affect microbial community composition

## Background reading
Johan does not expect us to read these entire papers. Johan want you to look at the Methods sections and compare the approaches and steps taken. Johan also want you to look at the figures and be a bit inspired to what you can do in terms of visualisation of data and what types of analyses you can do. You can find the papers here:

## Relevant questions to keep in mind:
- What tools to use?
- What databases are available?
- What statistical analyses are possible/feasible?
- Which samples can be used as "test" vs. "control"?

## Required files
The required files are located at: /cephyr/NOBACKUP/groups/bbt045_2024/PROJECT_DATA

The area for common files on the server is: /cephyr/NOBACKUP/groups/bbt045_2024/project_group1

See Project Intro on Canvas for the map over where the samples were taken
For each sample, there are two files: _1 contains the forward reads, _2 the reverse reads
